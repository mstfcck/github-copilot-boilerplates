# GitHub Copilot Boilerplates - AI Development Assistant

This is a comprehensive GitHub Copilot Boilerplate project designed to accelerate development across multiple technology stacks through AI-guided best practices and standardized development templates.

This project provides a collection of carefully crafted boilerplates with pre-defined GitHub Copilot instructions, prompts, and documentation to help developers quickly set up new projects while maintaining high code quality and consistency.

## Core Principles and Guidelines

**MUST** follow these fundamental principles when creating or using boilerplates:
- **Consistency**: All boilerplates follow standardized structure and documentation formats
- **Quality**: Every boilerplate includes comprehensive testing, security, and performance guidelines
- **AI-First**: Designed specifically for GitHub Copilot and AI-assisted development
- **Modularity**: Instructions are organized into focused, reusable modules
- **Best Practices**: Incorporates industry-standard patterns and proven approaches

## Boilerplate Creation Standards

**MUST** follow the comprehensive boilerplate creation standards defined in:
- **[Boilerplate Creation Instructions](./instructions/boilerplate.instructions.md)**: Complete specification for creating new boilerplates

## Available Boilerplates

This project includes the following technology-specific boilerplates:

### Spring Boilerplate
**USE** for enterprise Java development with Spring Boot applications
- Enterprise-grade Spring Boot 3.x setup
- Comprehensive security, testing, and performance guidelines
- Multiple architecture patterns (monolithic, microservices, cloud-native)
- Production-ready configurations and deployment guides

### MCP Boilerplate  
**USE** for Model Context Protocol application development
- Protocol-compliant MCP implementations
- Multi-language SDK support (Python, TypeScript, Java, C#, Kotlin)
- AI integration patterns and context-aware system design
- Reference server implementations and examples

## Development Standards

**ENSURE** all contributions follow these standards:
- Use RFC 2119/8174 specification keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.)
- Follow standardized directory structures and file naming conventions
- Include comprehensive AI-guided instructions and prompts
- Provide practical code examples and implementation patterns
- Maintain consistent documentation quality and format

**DO** implement these patterns:
- Modular instruction files for specialized development areas
- Ready-to-use prompts for common development scenarios
- Technology-specific best practices and guidelines
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance processes

**DON'T** implement these anti-patterns:
- Inconsistent documentation formats or structures
- Technology-biased or subjective recommendations
- Incomplete or untested instruction sets
- Poor organization or unclear guidance

## Quality Requirements

**MUST** include for every boilerplate:
- Complete `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with AI guidance
- Modular instruction files for architecture, security, testing
- Comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
- Technology-appropriate .gitignore and configuration files
- Practical code examples and implementation patterns

**SHOULD** consider:
- Ready-to-use prompts for common development scenarios
- Advanced configuration examples and optimization guides
- Integration examples with popular tools and services
- Community resource links and reference documentation

**NICE TO HAVE**:
- Video tutorials or visual guides
- Performance benchmarks and optimization case studies
- Advanced security scanning and monitoring configurations
- Cloud deployment templates and CI/CD pipeline examples

## Sub-Instructions

This project includes the following specialized instruction files:

- **[Boilerplate Creation Instructions](./instructions/boilerplate.instructions.md)**: **REQUIRED** specification for creating new boilerplates
- **[Specification Keywords Guide](./instructions/specification-keywords.instructions.md)**: **REQUIRED** usage guide for RFC 2119/8174 keywords
- **[Template Structure Guide](./instructions/template-structure.instructions.md)**: **REQUIRED** exact template structure for new boilerplates
- **[Git Ignore Instructions](./instructions/gitignore.instructions.md)**: Version control best practices and file exclusion patterns

## Documentation Standards

**MUST** maintain comprehensive documentation under the `./docs` directory:
- Technology-specific documentation and specifications
- API documentation and reference guides  
- Deployment guides and environment configuration
- Example implementations and usage scenarios

**ALWAYS** ensure documentation is:
- Current and accurate with latest technology versions
- Well-structured with clear navigation and organization
- Practical with actionable examples and code samples
- Comprehensive covering all major use cases and scenarios

This project serves as the foundation for AI-guided development acceleration, providing developers with proven patterns, comprehensive guidance, and standardized approaches to building high-quality applications efficiently.
