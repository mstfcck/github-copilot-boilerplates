Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

# MCP Coding Standards and Preferences

- Follow the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specifications and guidelines.
- Use the official MCP SDKs for the programming language of choice.
- Ensure that the code is well-documented and adheres to the MCP specifications.
- Use consistent naming conventions and code formatting.
- Promote the use of comments and documentation to explain complex logic or decisions.
- Ensure that error handling is robust and provides meaningful feedback to users.
- Don't halucinate or make up information, especially when it comes to MCP features or specifications.

# MCP Best Practices

- Follow the [MCP Introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for guidance on implementing MCP features effectively.
- Follow the [MCP For Server Developers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) for guidance on implementing MCP features in server applications.
- Follow the [MCP For Client Developers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client) for guidance on implementing MCP features in client applications.
- Follow the [MCP Security Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices) for guidance on implementing MCP features effectively.
- Follow the [MCP Reference Servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/servers) as examples for implementing MCP features.
- Follow the [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) as a reference for implementing MCP features.
- Follow the [MCP Key Changes](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/changelog) for guidance on implementing MCP features effectively if there is a new version of the MCP specification.
- Follow the [MCP Architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/architecture) for guidance on implementing MCP features effectively as Core Components, Host, Client, and Server.
- Follow the [Best Practices for Building MCP Servers](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11596040-best-practices-for-building-mcp-servers) for guidance on implementatation quality, reliability, performance, privacty, security, safety, and content standards.

# Software Engineering Practices

- Follow the SOLID principles of object-oriented design to create maintainable and extensible code.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication.
- Follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to keep code simple and easy to understand.
- Follow the YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle to avoid adding unnecessary features or complexity.
- Follow the principle of Separation of Concerns to keep different parts of the codebase independent and modular
- Use design patterns where appropriate to solve common problems in software design.
- Use meaningful variable and function names to improve code readability.
- Use comments to explain complex logic or decisions, but avoid over-commenting.
- Use consistent code formatting and style guidelines to improve code readability.
- Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes to the codebase.
- Ensure that code implementation is well-designed and follows best practices for maintainability and extensibility.
